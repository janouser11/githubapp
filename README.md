# GithubIssues

This project is hosted in Heroku at `https://githubissuesapp.herokuapp.com/`. If it does not load right away, be patient while Heroku fires up.

## Development server

Run `npm run-script serve` or `ng serve` for the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` or `npm run-script build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `npm run-script heroku-postbuild` flag for a production build.

After building, run `npm run-script start` or `node server.js` to use node to serve up the files. Visit `http://localhost:8080/` to see build
